  notes: High variance in PvP if you don't run dark attackers, but his slide can potentially
    speed up your entire team. 15% crit rate increase for the entire team is great

    damage increase.

  notes: Epona can be used as a pseudo-tank if you manipulate her attack to be 2nd
    highest in the team, allowing Chang'e to speed her up for more shield and vampirism
    uptime. During Ragna, she can keep your whole team healthy by herself if you play
    manually. However, this won't be the case on auto, as AI loves to use her tap

  notes: Brownie requires you to have at least 2 other wood childs to take full advantage
    of her buff, which limits her teambuilding capabilities - however, in the right
