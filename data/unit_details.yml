  tap: Deals 381 damage to target and 52.5% chance to fully charge skill gauge to
    random ally (excluding self).
  slide: Deals 663 damage to target and skill gauge charge +40% for 2 turns and slide

  drive: Deals 1789 damage and 80% chance to stun for 12s to 3 enemies that are charging
    skill and +400 drive gauge.
  notes: Kouga is the best support unit in the game and a must have. Her buffs can
    help attackers deal more damage or help your team survive by targeting a healer
    on the team - Healers have long cooldowns, so Kouga is great at decreasing it
    with her slide. Her tap is usually more RNG even at +6 uncap, and even at 83%
    she will not activate her tap passive skill if spammed. The tap skill will also
    only fully charge an ally's skill gauge if they are not on a counter cooldown,
    so use it wisely. Great with Dana or Syrinx.

  notes: Dana is the best tank in the game in all modes, except WorldBoss where Maris
    (water tank) is better. Her shields + defense up helps to survive against raid
    drives. Running Dana with a single healer like Maat or Leda will give your team
    high survivability.

    before enemy does. Even though his debuffs aren't 100%, they are still high enough
    for him to be a very useful unit to use in PVP and PVE. His debuffs are useless
    in Raids and WorldBoss modes. Some SoulCards can counter his "Silence" debuff.

    Useless in Raids and WorldBoss.

  element: grass
  tier: 9 9 8 5
  leader: Heal and Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) amount +5% to grass units
  auto: Deals 96 damage.
  tap: Deals 335 damage to target and gives Invincibility for 10s or 2 hits to ally
    with highest attack.
  slide: Gives 141HP Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) for 14s and Invincibility
    for 20s or 4 hits to 2 allies with lowest HP.
  drive: Gives 199HP Regeneration (Heal every 2seconds) for 16s and Invincibility
    for 15s or 3 hits to 3 allies with lowest HP.
  notes: Syrinx doesn't have the strongest heals per tick, but her Fortitude (invincibility)
    buffs help minimize(decrease to 0) the damage received and thus less healing is
    required. In PVP her buff can help negate damage when a poisoned ally is attacking
    since each attack (regardless of number of hits) only destroys one stack of Fortitude
    - Bleeding destroys stacks much faster.. Not a great healer in WorldBoss.
