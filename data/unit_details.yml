  notes: Kouga is the best support unit in the game and a must have. Her buffs can
    help attackers deal more damage or help your team survive by targeting a healer
    on the team - Healers have long cooldowns, so Kouga is great at decreasing it
    with her slide. Her tap is usually more RNG even at +6 uncap, and even at 83%
    she will not activate her tap passive skill if spammed. The tap skill will also
    only fully charge an ally's skill gauge if they are not on a counter cooldown,
    so use it wisely. Great with Dana or Syrinx.

  notes: Dana is the best tank in the game in all modes, except WorldBoss where Maris

    drives. Running Dana with a single healer like Maat or Leda will give your team
    high survivability.

  notes: Similar to Rusalka, but Metis' Berserk buff on drive is very useful in UndergroundEx
    and even raids - The downside is that her drive is hard to get the attacker buffed
    because she only buffs the lowest HP units, and then stuns for 5 seconds. With
    RNG on your side she can be quite good.

    for him to be a very useful unit to use in PVP and PVE. His debuffs are useless

  notes: Shares the highest poison dmg with Eve but lasts 4 turns vs Eve's 3 turns.
    Downside is his slide targets highest attack vs Eve's lowest health making him
    worse. Tap Skill is worse than Eve due to lower base damage for fever. Still a
    good alternative for Eve for poison dealing.

  notes: Syrinx doesn't have the strongest heals per tick, but her Fortitude buffs
    help minimize(decrease to 0) the damage received and thus less healing is required.
    In PVP her buff can help negate damage but when faced with DoTs, they destroys
    Fortitude stacks much faster.
